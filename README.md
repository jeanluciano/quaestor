Quaestor is a Claude Code plugin that provides Skills and slash commands for specification-driven development. Write lightweight specs, implement with context, ship with confidence.

**Design Principles:**
- **Zen** - Minimal surface area, maximum utility
- **Engineer as Driver** - You make decisions, Quaestor provides structure
- **Light Spec-Driven** - Just enough specification to stay aligned

## What's Included

**7 Skills** (auto-activate based on context):
- `spec-driven-development` - Create and manage specifications
- `implementation-workflow` - Implement features with quality gates
- `review-and-ship` - Code review and PR generation
- `debugging-workflow` - Systematic bug investigation
- `security-audit` - Security analysis and vulnerability detection
- `performance-optimization` - Performance profiling and optimization
- `project-initialization` - Setup Quaestor in any project

**3 Slash Commands:**
- `/plan` - Create specifications
- `/implement` - Implement specs with tracking
- `/research` - Explore codebase patterns

**Spec Lifecycle:**
- Folder-based state: `draft/` â†’ `active/` â†’ `completed/`
- Automatic progress tracking via checkboxes
- Max 3 active specs (enforced)

## Installation

### As a Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

First, add the Quaestor marketplace:
```bash
/plugin marketplace add jeanluciano/quaestor
```

Then install the plugin:
```bash
/plugin install quaestor:quaestor
```

See [Claude Code plugins documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) for details.

### Via pip/uv (Project-Level)

For project-level installation:
```bash
pip install quaestor
# or
uv pip install quaestor
```

Then initialize in your project:
```bash
quaestor init
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the plugin
claude plugins install quaestor

# In Claude Code, create a spec
/plan "User authentication with JWT"

# Implement it
/implement spec-auth-001

# Ship it
"Create a pull request for spec-auth-001"
```

Skills activate automatically based on what you're doing. Just describe what you want in natural language:
- "Show my active specs" â†’ spec-driven-development skill
- "Debug the login failure" â†’ debugging-workflow skill
- "Review this code for security issues" â†’ security-audit skill

## How It Works

### Specifications
Create lightweight specifications that define:
- What you're building (title and description)
- Why you're building it (motivation)
- What success looks like (acceptance criteria as checkboxes)

Specs live in `.quaestor/specs/` and move through folders as they progress:
```
.quaestor/specs/
â”œâ”€â”€ draft/      # Planned work
â”œâ”€â”€ active/     # In progress (max 3)
â””â”€â”€ completed/  # Finished
```

### Skills
Skills are auto-activating workflows that trigger based on context. You don't invoke them directly - just describe what you want:
- Want to plan? Say "create a spec for X" â†’ spec-driven-development activates
- Want to implement? Use `/implement spec-id` â†’ implementation-workflow activates
- Want to ship? Say "create a PR" â†’ review-and-ship activates

### Example Session
```bash
# Create a spec
/plan "Add rate limiting to API endpoints"
# â†’ spec-feature-042.md created in draft/

# Start implementing
/implement spec-feature-042
# â†’ Skills guide you through implementation with quality checks

# Check progress
"What's the status of spec-feature-042?"
# â†’ "spec-feature-042: 3/5 criteria complete (60%)"

# Ship it
"Create a pull request for spec-feature-042"
# â†’ PR created with spec context included
```
