## üîÑ WORKFLOW PATTERN

### Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement

**ALWAYS follow this pattern for non-trivial tasks:**

1. **RESEARCH FIRST**
   - Required Response: "Let me research the codebase first..."
   - Use grep/read to understand existing patterns
   - Check similar implementations
   - Understand dependencies

2. **PLAN BEFORE IMPLEMENTING**  
   - Required Response: "Based on my research, here's my plan..."
   - Present approach for approval
   - Identify files to modify
   - Consider edge cases

3. **IMPLEMENT WITH QUALITY**
   - Follow the approved plan
   - Use appropriate subagents
   - Test as you go
   - Validate changes

**EXCEPTIONS:**
- Trivial changes (typos, simple fixes)
- Explicit user override
- Emergency debugging

maintain_structure:
  src_layout:
    quaestor/:
      cli/: "CLI commands only"
      core/: "Business logic and managers"
      utils/: "Shared utilities"
      claude/: "AI integration"
  
  new_features:
    - assess: "Which layer does this belong in?"
    - follow: "Existing patterns in that layer"
    - maintain: "Clear separation of concerns"
  
  imports:
    - relative: "Within same package"
    - absolute: "Cross-package imports"
    - circular: "NEVER create circular imports"
```

## ‚õî ENFORCEMENT

```yaml
violations:
  immediate_stop:
    - "Modifying without running tests"
    - "Direct file writes without atomicity"
    - "Adding business logic to dataclasses"
    - "Ignoring hook recommendations"
  
  correction_required:
    - acknowledge: "I need to follow [RULE]"
    - fix: "Correct the violation"
    - verify: "Run tests and linting"
    - proceed: "Only after compliance"
```

---
**REMEMBER**: These rules ensure code quality, security, and maintainability in the Quaestor Python CLI project. They are tailored to the specific architecture and patterns already established in the codebase.

**CRITICAL REMINDERS**:
- Always run `make lint` and `make test` before considering work complete
- Use managers for logic, dataclasses for data
- All file operations must be atomic with proper error handling
- Hook feedback is mandatory, not optional
- Create specifications for new features and track progress
