# Specification: Create specification-driven workflow documentation

## Use Case Overview

**ID**: spec-agent-005  
**Primary Actor**: Developer updating documentation  
**Goal**: Transform user validation and workflow documentation to use specifications  
**Priority**: medium

## Context & Background

The project-init command contains user-facing templates and workflow descriptions that reference milestones. These need to be updated to show specifications and guide users through the specification-driven workflow.

## Main Success Scenario

1. Developer updates validation templates to show specifications
2. Developer modifies workflow sections for specification creation
3. Developer updates success criteria references
4. Developer adds agent invocation examples
5. Developer creates specification visualization examples
6. Users see consistent specification-driven guidance

## Contract Definition

### Inputs
```yaml
inputs:
  current_templates:
    type: "markdown"
    description: "Current validation and workflow templates"
    sections:
      - "Project Analysis Validation"
      - "Milestone Creation"
      - "Success Criteria"
      - "Workflow examples"
```

### Outputs
```yaml
outputs:
  updated_documentation:
    type: "markdown"
    description: "Specification-driven documentation"
    includes:
      - Updated validation templates
      - Specification creation workflow
      - Agent invocation examples
      - Visual specification roadmap
      - Success criteria with specs
```

### Behavior Rules
- Maintain template structure for consistency
- Use clear specification terminology throughout
- Include concrete examples of specifications
- Show agent orchestration patterns
- Reference /impl instead of /task command

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Project Analysis Validation" shows "Proposed Specifications"
- [ ] "Milestone Creation" section renamed to "Specification Creation"
- [ ] Validation template includes specification examples with IDs
- [ ] Success criteria reference "specification ready for /impl"
- [ ] Agent invocation patterns are documented with examples
- [ ] Specification roadmap visualization is included
- [ ] Workflow guides users through specification lifecycle
- [ ] All /task references updated to /impl

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Validation template shows specifications
```gherkin
Given the updated validation template
When project-init presents options to user
Then it should display "Proposed Specifications:"
And each specification should have an ID and priority
And options should reference specification creation
```

### Scenario 2: Workflow documentation is complete
```gherkin
Given the specification creation section
When reviewing the workflow
Then it should explain specification structure
And show contract definition process
And include acceptance criteria examples
```

### Scenario 3: Agent examples are clear
```gherkin
Given the agent invocation documentation
When reading examples
Then each agent usage should be explained
And include actual invocation syntax
And show expected outputs
```

## Implementation Notes

Example validation template update:
```markdown
## Project Analysis Validation ‚úã

**Detected Configuration:**
- Framework: React with TypeScript
- Architecture: Component-based with Redux
- Complexity: 0.7/1.0
- Phase: Growth

**Proposed Specifications:**
1. [spec-001]: User Authentication System (high priority)
   - Type: feature
   - Estimated: 2 weeks
2. [spec-002]: API Integration Layer (high priority)
   - Type: enhancement
   - Estimated: 1 week
3. [spec-003]: Performance Optimization (medium priority)
   - Type: enhancement
   - Estimated: 1 week

**Your Options:**
- ‚úÖ Proceed with proposed specifications
- üîÑ Modify specification list
- üìù Custom specification definition
- üö´ Start with minimal setup

**Specification Creation:**
- ‚≠ê Create specification files (.quaestor/specifications/*.yaml)
- üìù Documentation only (just populate MEMORY.md)
```

## Dependencies

- Should be implemented after spec-agent-002 (terminology updates)
- Benefits from spec-agent-003 (agent patterns) being complete

## Estimated Effort

2-3 hours for documentation updates and examples
