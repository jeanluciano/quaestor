# Phase 5: Predictive Engine

## Overview
Build machine learning-based prediction system that learns from developer patterns to predict next actions, suggest missing implementations, and provide proactive assistance.

## Timeline
**Duration:** Weeks 7-8 (10-14 days)
**Status:** Not Started

## Goals
1. Create pattern recognition system
2. Build next action prediction engine
3. Detect workflow templates automatically
4. Provide intelligent suggestions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Next file prediction >70% accuracy
- [ ] Missing test detection >80% accuracy
- [ ] Workflow patterns identified correctly
- [ ] Suggestions accepted >50% of time
- [ ] Learning improves with usage

## Technical Requirements
- ML model for sequence prediction
- Pattern matching algorithms
- Workflow template extraction
- Real-time suggestion engine

## Dependencies
- Deep context system operational
- Sufficient training data collected
- TUI dashboard for predictions display
