# Phase 3: Rule Intelligence

## Overview
Implement graduated enforcement system with context-aware rule adaptation based on detected intent and learning from developer patterns.

## Timeline
**Duration:** Weeks 3-4 (10-14 days)
**Status:** Not Started

## Goals
1. Implement graduated enforcement (Inform/Warn/Justify/Block)
2. Build context-aware rule adaptation system
3. Create rule learning mechanism
4. Track and analyze rule exceptions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All enforcement levels functional
- [ ] Rules adapt based on detected intent
- [ ] Exception patterns learned and applied
- [ ] 50%+ reduction in false positives
- [ ] Rule effectiveness metrics available

## Technical Requirements
- Rule engine with dynamic configuration
- Machine learning for pattern detection
- Persistent storage for learned exceptions
- Rule evaluation performance <10ms

## Dependencies
- Intent detection system operational
- TUI dashboard for rule status display
- Hook system provides sufficient context
