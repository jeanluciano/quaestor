# Phase 4: Deep Context

## Overview
Integrate LSP-like deep code analysis capabilities similar to pretty-mod, providing semantic understanding of code structure, dependencies, and relationships.

## Timeline
**Duration:** Weeks 5-6 (10-14 days)
**Status:** Not Started

## Goals
1. Integrate pretty-mod style code analysis
2. Build comprehensive import graphs
3. Map test coverage relationships
4. Enable semantic code understanding

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Full module structure analysis operational
- [ ] Import relationships mapped accurately
- [ ] Test coverage tracked per function
- [ ] Cross-file dependencies understood
- [ ] Context queries respond <100ms

## Technical Requirements
- AST parsing for multiple languages
- Graph database for relationships
- Incremental analysis updates
- Language server protocol support

## Dependencies
- Rule intelligence system complete
- TUI dashboard for context display
- Sufficient computing resources for analysis
