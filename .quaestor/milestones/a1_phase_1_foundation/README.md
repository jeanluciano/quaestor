# Phase 1: A1 Foundation

## Overview
Build the foundational infrastructure for A1 as a Quaestor addon that processes hook events and enables automatic intelligence features.

## Timeline
**Duration:** Week 1 (5-7 days)
**Status:** Not Started

## Goals
1. Set up A1 as a Quaestor addon module
2. Implement basic hook event processing system
3. Create event queue for real-time processing
4. Build basic intent detection from event patterns

## Success Criteria
- [ ] A1 service starts automatically with Quaestor
- [ ] All Claude Code hooks captured and processed
- [ ] Event queue handles 100+ events/second
- [ ] Basic intent detection with 70%+ accuracy
- [ ] No performance impact on Quaestor operations

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.12+ async architecture
- Event-driven design with queue system
- Zero-config automatic startup
- Graceful degradation if A1 fails

## Dependencies
- Quaestor hook system must be stable
- Claude Code hook documentation available
- Event schema defined and versioned
