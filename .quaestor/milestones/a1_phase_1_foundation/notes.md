# Phase 1: Foundation - Implementation Notes

## Architecture Decisions

### Event Processing Design
- Use asyncio for non-blocking event handling
- Queue-based architecture for scalability
- Event sourcing pattern for replay capability

### Integration Points
- Hook into existing Quaestor event system
- Minimal changes to core Quaestor code
- Plugin-style architecture for easy removal

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Target: <1ms overhead per hook event
- Async processing to avoid blocking Claude Code
- Bounded queue to prevent memory issues

### Reliability
- Graceful degradation if A1 crashes
- Event persistence for recovery
- Health check system

## Implementation Order
1. Basic module structure and lifecycle
2. Event schema and validation
3. Queue system with monitoring
4. Intent detection algorithms
5. Integration and testing

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should events be persisted to disk?
- [ ] What's the optimal queue size?
- [ ] How to handle event replay?
