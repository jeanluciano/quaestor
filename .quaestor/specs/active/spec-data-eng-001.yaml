title: "Data Engineering Agent for Quaestor Framework"
type: feature
status: draft
priority: high
description: |
  Develop a comprehensive data engineering agent for the Quaestor framework 
  that provides end-to-end ETL pipeline generation, data quality validation, 
  and advanced data processing capabilities.

rationale: |
  Modern data engineering requires flexible, robust tools that can handle 
  complex data workflows across multiple sources and formats. This agent 
  will provide a standardized, production-ready solution for data pipeline 
  development within the Quaestor ecosystem.

  requires: 
    - "quaestor-core"
    - "python-etl-libraries"
  blocks: []
  related: 
    - "spec-agent-framework-001"

risks:
  - description: "Complexity of supporting multiple data sources"
    likelihood: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: "Implement modular source adapters with robust error handling"
  
  - description: "Performance overhead in data validation"
    likelihood: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: "Implement efficient sampling and parallel processing strategies"

success_metrics:
  - "95% data quality detection rate"
  - "20% performance improvement in ETL processes"
  - "Zero data loss during schema migrations"
  - "Sub-second latency for streaming pipelines"

      description: "Configuration for data source"
      validation: 
        - "Must include connection details"
        - "Supports multiple source types"

        type: "postgres"
        host: "localhost"
        port: 5432
    
    pipeline_config:
      type: object

  behavior:
    - "Generate complete, production-ready ETL pipeline code"
    - "Perform comprehensive data quality checks"
    - "Optimize data processing performance"
    - "Support multiple data source integrations"
  
  constraints:
    - "Must support Python-based data processing"
    - "No external API calls without explicit configuration"
    - "Minimize third-party library dependencies"
  
  error_handling:
    DataSourceConnectionError:
      when: "Connection to data source fails"
      response: "Detailed error logging, connection retry mechanism"
      recovery: "Attempt reconnection with exponential backoff"
    
    DataValidationError:
      when: "Data fails quality checks"
      response: "Generate detailed validation report"
      recovery: "Provide options for data cleaning or rejection"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "ETL pipeline generator produces production-ready, fully commented code"
  - "Data quality validation detects 95%+ of known data issues"
  - "Performance optimization achieves minimum 20% processing speed improvement"
  - "Schema migrations execute with guaranteed zero data loss"
  - "Streaming data pipelines maintain sub-second end-to-end latency"
  - "Supports at least 5 different data source types"
  - "All generated code includes comprehensive error handling"

  - name: "PostgreSQL to BigQuery ETL Pipeline"
    description: "End-to-end ETL from relational to analytics database"
    given: "Sample customer database in PostgreSQL"
    when: "Generate and execute ETL pipeline"
    then: "Data successfully transformed and loaded with 100% integrity"
    examples:
      - source_type: "postgresql"
        destination_type: "bigquery"
        data_volume: "1 million records"
  
  - name: "Streaming Log Data Processing"
    description: "Real-time log data validation and processing"
    given: "Continuous log stream from web application"
