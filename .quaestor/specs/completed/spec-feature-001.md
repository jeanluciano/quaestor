# Lightweight Task Progress Tracking for Quaestor Specifications

## Description
Implement a simple, AI-friendly task progress tracking mechanism directly within Markdown specifications. This feature will enhance Quaestor's specification management by providing an intuitive way to track task completion and calculate overall progress.

## Rationale
Current specification management lacks a built-in method for tracking task progress. By adding lightweight checkbox-based tracking, we can:
- Provide immediate visibility into specification completion
- Enable AI agents to understand and report task status
- Maintain the simplicity and readability of existing specifications
- Support incremental implementation and progressive enhancement

## Dependencies
- No direct dependencies
- Builds upon existing Markdown specification parser

## Risks
- Potential performance overhead in parsing
- Risk of over-complicating the specification format
- Ensuring backwards compatibility with existing specs

## Success Metrics
- 90% of existing specifications can be parsed without modification
- Progress calculation accuracy within +/- 5%
- Less than 10ms overhead for progress calculation
- Support for 100+ task items per specification

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement checkbox parsing in existing markdown_spec.py
- [x] Add progress calculation method
- [x] Support standard Markdown checkbox formats:
  - [x] Unchecked: `- [ ] Task description`
  - [x] Checked: `- [x] Completed task`
  - [x] Uncertain: `- [?] Uncertain task`
- [x] Detect and handle various checkbox styles
- [x] Provide total, completed, and uncertain task counts
- [x] Calculate percentage completion
- [x] Maintain zero-configuration approach
- [x] Do not modify existing specifications
- [x] Provide informative warnings for edge cases

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Progress Calculation
**Given**: A specification with mixed checked and unchecked tasks
**When**: Progress is calculated
**Then**: Correct percentage is returned

### Uncertain Task Handling
**Given**: A specification with uncertain tasks
**When**: Progress is calculated
**Then**: Uncertain tasks are reported separately

### Edge Case Handling
**Given**: Specification with no tasks
**When**: Progress is calculated
**Then**: 100% progress reported with appropriate warning

## Implementation Phases
