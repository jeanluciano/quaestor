# Quaestor Project Memory & Progress Tracking

## Document Purpose
This file tracks the current state, progress, and future plans for Quaestor. It serves as the "memory" of what has been done, what's in progress, and what's planned.

## Current Status

```yaml
status:
  last_updated: "2025-07-22"
  current_phase: "Alpha → 1.0 Stabilization"
  current_milestone: "Approaching 1.0 Release"
  overall_progress: "85% - Core features complete, stabilizing for production"
```

## Quick Summary

```yaml
project_focus: "AI-assisted development context management platform"
progress:
  completed:
    - "Core Quaestor context management system"
    - "Dual-mode installation (personal/team)"
    - "Hook system with pre/post execution"
    - "Template engine with project detection"
    - "A1 Phase 1: Core Learning"
    - "A1 Phase 2: TUI Dashboard"
    - "A1 Phase 3: Rule Intelligence"
    - "Graduated enforcement (INFORM→WARN→JUSTIFY→BLOCK)"
  in_progress:
    - "API stabilization for 1.0"
    - "Documentation completion"
    - "Performance optimization"
    - "Production readiness testing"
  planned:
    - "1.0 Release"
    - "Plugin marketplace"
    - "Team collaboration features"
    - "Cloud synchronization"
    - "IDE integrations"
```

## Active Milestones

### 1.0 Release Preparation
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Target**: Q3 2025
- **Focus**: Stability, documentation, production readiness
- **Location**: `.quaestor/milestones/1_0_release_prep/`

### A1 Intelligence System
- **Status**: Phase 3 Complete
- **Phases Completed**:
  - Phase 1: Core Learning (pattern recognition)
  - Phase 2: TUI Dashboard (real-time monitoring)
  - Phase 3: Rule Intelligence (adaptive enforcement)
- **Location**: `.quaestor/milestones/a1_phase_*/`

## Key Decisions & Context

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Monolith**: Core stability with plugin extensibility
2. **File-Based Storage**: Human-readable, VCS-friendly
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: A1 enhances but doesn't replace core
4. **Event-Driven A1**: Loose coupling for reliability

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12+ (modern features)
- **CLI**: Typer (declarative, type-safe)
- **UI**: Rich (formatting) + Textual (TUI)
- **Quality**: Ruff (fast linting), pytest (testing)
- **Package Manager**: UV (modern Python tooling)

### Development Philosophy
- **Context-First**: All decisions consider AI context
- **Developer Experience**: Fast, intuitive, helpful
- **Graduated Enforcement**: Guide don't block
- **Learn & Adapt**: System improves with use

## Recent Changes

### Version 0.5.1
- Fixed template population for VALIDATION.md and AUTOMATION.md
- Completed A1 Phase 3 Rule Intelligence
- Enhanced updater to check all template files
- Added critical rule about source vs installation files

### Version 0.5.0
- Hook installation system
- Nix support
- A1 TUI dashboard
- Research workflow tracking

## Known Issues & Tech Debt

### Current Issues
- Template engine performance on large projects
- TUI dashboard memory usage with long sessions
- Hook timeout handling edge cases

### Tech Debt
- Refactor project analyzer for better extensibility
- Consolidate duplicate pattern detection logic
- Improve test coverage for edge cases
- Document internal APIs

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Complete API documentation
2. Performance profiling and optimization
3. Production deployment guide
4. Security audit

### Short Term (This Month)
1. Release 1.0.0
2. Launch documentation site
3. Create video tutorials
4. Community outreach

### Long Term (This Quarter)
1. Plugin marketplace design
2. Cloud sync architecture
3. Team collaboration features
4. Enterprise features planning

## Integration Points

### Current Integrations
- Claude AI (via CLAUDE.md)
- Git (version control awareness)
- Language toolchains (auto-detection)
- CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions)

### Planned Integrations
- VS Code extension
- IntelliJ plugin
- Slack/Discord bots
- Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)

## Performance Metrics

```yaml
targets:
  startup_time: "<100ms"
  command_execution: "<200ms"
  memory_usage: "<50MB baseline"
  file_operations: "<10ms per file"
```

## Development Patterns

### Adding New Features
1. Start in A1 for experimentation
2. Validate with community
3. Promote to core if stable
4. Maintain backward compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- E2E tests for user scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

### Release Process
1. Feature freeze
2. Testing sprint
3. Documentation update
4. Community preview
5. Official release
