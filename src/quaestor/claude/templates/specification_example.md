# Specification: User Authentication Flow

## Use Case Overview

**ID**: auth-001  
**Primary Actor**: End User  
**Goal**: Securely authenticate users and establish a session  
**Priority**: critical

## Context & Background

The system needs a secure authentication mechanism that supports email/password login with proper session management. This is a foundational feature required before any user-specific functionality can be implemented.

## Main Success Scenario

1. User navigates to login page
2. User enters email and password
3. System validates credentials format client-side
4. System sends authentication request to server
5. Server validates credentials against database
6. Server generates JWT token on success
7. System stores token and redirects to dashboard
8. User session persists across page reloads

## Contract Definition

### Inputs
```yaml
inputs:
  login_request:
    email: 
      type: string
      required: true
      format: valid_email
      example: "user@example.com"
    password:
      type: string
      required: true
      min_length: 8
      example: "SecureP@ss123"
    remember_me:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      default: false
```

### Outputs
```yaml
outputs:
  success_response:
    status: 200
    body:
      token: 
        type: string
        format: JWT
        example: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
      user:
        id: string
        email: string
        name: string
        role: string
      expires_in: 
        type: integer
        description: "Seconds until token expiration"
        
  error_responses:
    invalid_credentials:
      status: 401
      body:
        error: "INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
        message: "Invalid email or password"
    
    rate_limited:
      status: 429
      body:
        error: "RATE_LIMITED"
        message: "Too many login attempts. Please try again later."
        retry_after: integer  # seconds
```

### Behavior Rules
- Email validation must occur before password validation
- Failed login attempts increment a counter per email
- After 5 failed attempts within 1 hour, account is temporarily locked
- Successful login resets the failed attempt counter
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours (or 7 days if remember_me is true)
- All authentication attempts must be logged for security auditing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can login with valid email and password
- [ ] Invalid email format shows client-side validation error
- [ ] Invalid credentials return appropriate error without revealing which field is wrong
- [ ] User remains logged in after page refresh
- [ ] User is redirected to originally requested page after login
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] Login form is accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- [ ] Password field has proper autocomplete attributes
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for all authentication requests

## Business Rules

1. **Password Policy**: Minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number
2. **Session Duration**: 24 hours default, 7 days with "remember me"
3. **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts triggers 1-hour lockout
4. **Email Verification**: Only verified email addresses can authenticate
5. **Audit Trail**: All login attempts must be logged with timestamp, IP, and result

## Technical Constraints

- Must use bcrypt for password hashing (minimum cost factor 12)
- JWT tokens must use RS256 algorithm
- Tokens must include standard claims (iss, sub, aud, exp, iat)
- Session storage must be httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies
- API must follow RESTful conventions
- Response time must be under 200ms for 95% of requests

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Authentication endpoint must handle 100 requests/second
- Response time p95 < 200ms
- Database queries must use indexes on email field

### Security
- All traffic must be HTTPS
- Passwords never logged or transmitted in plain text
- Failed login attempts logged but passwords not recorded
- CORS properly configured
- CSRF protection enabled

### Scalability
- Stateless authentication allows horizontal scaling
- Session data stored in distributed cache (Redis)
- Database connections pooled appropriately

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
```yaml
scenario: "Successful login with valid credentials"
given: 
  - User exists with email "test@example.com"
  - Password is "ValidPass123!"
  - No previous failed attempts
when: 
  - POST /api/auth/login with valid credentials
then:
  - Response status is 200
  - Response contains valid JWT token
  - Response contains user object
  - Token is valid for 24 hours
  - Failed attempt counter remains at 0
```

### Edge Cases
1. **Login with unverified email**
   - Returns 403 with "EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED" error
   - Includes link to resend verification

2. **Login immediately after account unlock**
   - Should succeed if credentials are valid
   - Failed counter should be reset

3. **Concurrent login attempts**
   - System should handle race conditions
   - Only one session should be created

### Error Cases
1. **Invalid email format**
   - Client-side validation prevents submission
   - If bypassed, server returns 400 Bad Request

2. **SQL injection attempt**
   - Input sanitization prevents execution
   - Attempt is logged as security event

3. **Malformed JSON request**
   - Returns 400 with clear error message

## Implementation Notes

### Affected Components
- Frontend: Login page, auth service, session management
- Backend: Auth controller, user service, JWT service
- Database: Users table, login_attempts table
- Infrastructure: Redis for session storage

### Dependencies
- bcrypt library for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken library for JWT handling
- Rate limiting middleware
- Email validation library
- Redis client

### Migration Considerations
- Existing users may need password reset if upgrading hash algorithm
- Session tokens from old system must be invalidated
- Database indexes needed on users.email field
