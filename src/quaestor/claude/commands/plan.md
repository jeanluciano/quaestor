# /plan - Specification-Driven Planning & Progress Management

## Purpose
Design specifications, plan work through spec-driven development, manage projects, track progress, and make strategic decisions. Combines specification management with progress visualization and architectural planning.

## Usage
```
/plan                           # Show progress dashboard with specs
/plan --spec "User Auth"        # Create new specification
/plan --create "MVP Complete"   # Create new project phase
/plan --complete               # Complete current project phase
/plan --analyze                # Deep strategic analysis
/plan --architecture          # Architectural planning mode
/plan --link                   # Link current branch to spec
/plan --activate <spec-id>     # Move spec from draft to active
/plan --archive <spec-id>      # Move spec from active to completed
/plan --migrate                # Migrate flat specs to folders
```

## Auto-Intelligence

### Multi-Mode Planning
```yaml
Mode Detection:
  - No args ‚Üí Progress dashboard with folder stats
  - --spec ‚Üí Specification creation wizard (creates in draft/)
  - --create ‚Üí Project phase creation wizard
  - --complete ‚Üí Completion validation
  - --analyze ‚Üí Strategic analysis
  - --architecture ‚Üí System design planning
  - --link ‚Üí Branch-to-spec linkage
  - --activate ‚Üí Move spec to active/ folder
  - --archive ‚Üí Move spec to completed/ folder
  - --migrate ‚Üí Migrate flat specs to folders
```

### Agent Orchestration
```yaml

  - architect: Validate technical approach
  - implementer: Estimate complexity
  
Progress Analysis:
  - researcher: Gather spec status and metrics
  - architect: Analyze system evolution
  
Project Planning:
  - architect: Design project structure
  - planner: Break down into specifications
  - security: Risk assessment
  
Strategic Analysis:

```

## Execution: Analyze ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Track ‚Üí Archive

### Folder Management Integration
**Automatic folder-based specification lifecycle:**
```yaml
On First Run:
  - Initialize FolderManager with .quaestor/specifications/
  - Create folder structure: draft/, active/, completed/
  - Migrate existing flat specifications to appropriate folders
  - Update manifest with folder locations

Folder Operations:
  - New spec ‚Üí Create in draft/
  - Start work ‚Üí Move to active/ (max 3)
  - Complete ‚Üí Move to completed/
  - All moves atomic with git tracking

Specification Context:
  - Use active/ folder specs as source of truth
  - No separate MEMORY.md file needed
  - Context loaded directly from active specifications
  - Completed specs archived in completed/ folder
```

### Phase 0: Progress Dashboard üìä
**Default Mode - Comprehensive Status Overview:**
```yaml
Data Collection (Parallel):
  - Folder statistics: draft/active/completed counts via FolderManager
  - Active specifications: Read from active/ folder (max 3)
  - Active work: Read directly from active specifications
  - Git metrics: commits, velocity, contributors
  - Quality metrics: test/lint status per spec
  - Architecture health: dependency analysis
  - Project progress: folder-based completion tracking

## Specification Creation Workflow (--spec)

### Initial Setup
```yaml
Directory Structure:
  - Use FolderManager to create folder structure:
    - draft/     # New specifications start here
    - active/    # In-progress (max 3 specifications)
    - completed/ # Finished specifications
  - Automatic migration of existing flat specifications
  - Git integration for history preservation
```

### Guided Specification Process
```yaml
Context Gathering:
  1. Title: "What feature/fix are you planning?"
  2. Type: "Is this a feature, bugfix, refactor, etc?"
  3. Description: "What exactly needs to be built?"
  4. Rationale: "Why is this needed?"

Contract Definition:
  1. Inputs: "What data/parameters are required?"
  2. Outputs: "What will be produced/returned?"
  3. Behavior: "What are the key rules/logic?"
  4. Constraints: "Any performance/security requirements?"

Acceptance Criteria:
  - Define: measurable success conditions
  - Create: test scenarios with Given/When/Then
  - Link: to existing specifications if dependent

Branch Creation:
  - Generate: spec-compliant branch name
  - Link: specification to branch
  - Update: spec status to ACTIVE
```

### Specification Output Template
```yaml
Specification Created:
  ID: feat-auth-001
  Title: User Authentication System
  Type: feature
  Priority: high
  Status: DRAFT ‚Üí ACTIVE
  
  Contract:
    Inputs:
      - username: string (required)
      - password: string (required, min 8 chars)
    Outputs:
      - token: JWT string
      - user: User object
    Behavior:
      - Validate credentials against database
      - Generate JWT with 24h expiration
      - Log authentication attempts
      
  Branch: feat/spec-auth-001-user-authentication
  Folder: draft/ ‚Üí Will move to active/ when work begins
  
  Next Steps:
  1. Review specification contract
  2. Run /plan --activate spec-auth-001 to move to active/
  3. Implement according to acceptance criteria
  4. Run /plan --complete spec-auth-001 to archive
```

## Project Phase Creation Workflow

### Guided Creation Process
```yaml
Context Gathering:
  1. Goal: "What's the main objective?"
  2. Scope: "What are the key deliverables?"
  3. Criteria: "How will we measure success?"
  4. Duration: "Estimated timeframe?"

Specification Planning:
  - Identify: specifications needed for phase
  - Prioritize: critical vs nice-to-have specs
  - Estimate: complexity and dependencies
  
Template Generation:
  - Create: structured phase section in MEMORY.md
  - Initialize: specification tracking
  - Set: measurable success criteria
  - Link: to specification manifest
```

### Creation Output Template
```yaml
New Phase Structure:
  - Header: "üöÄ Phase: [Name]"

## Implementation Guide

**Using FolderManager:**
```python
from quaestor.core.folder_manager import FolderManager

# Initialize manager
folder_mgr = FolderManager(Path(".quaestor/specifications"))

# First run - setup folders
result = folder_mgr.create_folder_structure()
if result.success:
    # Migrate existing specs
    folder_mgr.migrate_flat_specifications()

# Move spec to active
result = folder_mgr.move_specification(
    Path("draft/spec-auth-001.yaml"), 
    "active"
)
```

**Folder Operations:**
- Create spec ‚Üí Save to draft/
- Activate ‚Üí Check limit, move to active/
- Complete ‚Üí Move to completed/, update memory
- All operations atomic with rollback
