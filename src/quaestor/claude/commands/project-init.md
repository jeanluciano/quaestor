# /project-init - Intelligent Project Initialization

## Purpose
Analyze project architecture, detect frameworks and patterns, then generate intelligent Quaestor setup with auto-populated documentation and specifications.

## Usage
```
/project-init
/project-init --type web-api
/project-init --existing --migrate
```

## Auto-Intelligence

### Framework Detection
```yaml
Stack Analysis:
  - Language: Auto-detect ‚Üí Python|Rust|JS|TS|Go standards
  - Framework: React|Django|Express|FastAPI|Axum patterns
  - Architecture: MVC|DDD|VSA|Microservices detection
  - Patterns: Repository|Service|CQRS|Event-driven
```

### Adaptive Setup
- **New projects**: Generate starter architecture + specifications
- **Existing projects**: Analyze current state + fill gaps
- **Migration**: Import existing docs + enhance with Quaestor

## Execution: Analyze ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Setup

### Phase 1: Project Analysis üîç

**Agent-Orchestrated Discovery:**

Use the Task tool to spawn specialized agents for parallel analysis:

```yaml
Parallel Agent Execution:
  1. Framework & Dependency Analysis:
     Agent: researcher
     Mission: "Analyze the project structure and identify:
       - Primary programming language and framework
       - Project dependencies from package.json/requirements.txt/Cargo.toml/go.mod
       - Test framework and current coverage
       - Build tools and scripts
       Output as structured YAML with framework, dependencies, and tools"
  
  2. Architecture Pattern Analysis:
     Agent: architect
     Mission: "Evaluate the codebase architecture:
       - Identify architecture patterns (MVC, DDD, VSA, Clean Architecture)
       - Map component relationships and boundaries
       - Assess API design patterns
       - Analyze database architecture
       - Identify technical debt and complexity hotspots
       Output as structured analysis with patterns, strengths, and concerns"
  
  3. Security Assessment:
     Agent: security
     Mission: "Perform security analysis on the project:
       - Identify security patterns and anti-patterns
       - Check for common vulnerabilities
       - Assess authentication/authorization approach
       - Review data handling and encryption
       - Evaluate dependency security
       Output as security assessment with risks and recommendations"
```

**Result Consolidation:**
After all agents complete, consolidate findings into a unified analysis:
```yaml
Consolidated Analysis:
  Framework: [from researcher]
  Architecture: [from architect]
  Security: [from security]
  Complexity: [calculated score]
  Phase: [new|growth|legacy based on analysis]
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Generation ‚ö°
**Agent-Driven Specification Creation:**

Use the planner agent to generate specifications based on consolidated analysis:

```yaml
Specification Generation:
  Agent: planner
  Context: [Consolidated analysis from Phase 1]
  Mission: "Based on the project analysis, create initial specifications:
    - Project type: [framework] in [phase] phase
    - Architecture: [patterns identified]
    - Security concerns: [from security analysis]
    - Current gaps: [from architect analysis]
    
    Generate 3-5 initial specifications that address:
    1. Foundation/setup needs for this project type
    2. Architecture improvements based on patterns found
    3. Security enhancements needed
    4. Technical debt identified
    5. Testing/quality improvements
    
    For each specification provide:
    - Title and description
    - Priority (critical/high/medium/low)
    - Estimated effort
    - Dependencies
    
    Output as structured YAML suitable for Quaestor specifications"
```

**Document Generation:**
Based on agent outputs, generate:
```yaml
Generated Documents:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: From architect agent analysis
  - MEMORY.md: With specifications from planner agent
  - .quaestor/specifications/: Initial spec files
  - CRITICAL_RULES.md: Framework-specific from analysis
```

### Phase 3: User Validation ‚úÖ **[MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP]**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULE:**
```yaml
before_phase_4:
  MUST_PRESENT_ANALYSIS:
    - framework_detection_results
    - architecture_pattern_analysis  
    - proposed_specifications
    - quality_standards_detected
  
  MUST_GET_USER_CHOICE:
    options:
      - "‚úÖ Proceed with detected setup"
      - "üîÑ Modify detected patterns" 
      - "üìù Custom architecture description"
      - "üö´ Start with minimal setup"
  
  VIOLATION_CONSEQUENCES:
    - if_skipped: "IMMEDIATE STOP - Restart from Phase 3"
    - required_response: "I must validate this analysis with you before proceeding"
```

**MANDATORY Interactive Confirmation Template:**
```
## Project Analysis Validation ‚úã

**Detected Configuration:**
- Framework: [detected_framework]
- Architecture: [detected_pattern]
- Complexity: [score]/1.0
- Phase: [project_phase]

**Proposed Specifications:**
[list_proposed_specifications]

**Quality Standards:**
[detected_tools_and_standards]

## Your Options:
- ‚úÖ Proceed with detected setup
- üîÑ Modify detected patterns
- üìù Custom architecture description  
- üö´ Start with minimal setup

## Specification Creation:
- ‚≠ê Create specification files (.quaestor/specifications/*.yaml)
- üìù Documentation only (just populate MEMORY.md templates)

What would you prefer for setup and specifications?
```

### Phase 4: Setup Completion üöÄ **[ONLY AFTER USER APPROVAL]**

**Document Generation:**
```yaml
Template Selection:
  - Framework-specific: React|Django|Express templates
  - Pattern-specific: MVC|DDD|VSA structures
  - Size-appropriate: Startup|Enterprise|Legacy setups
  
Auto-Population:
  - Real paths from project structure
  - Detected components and responsibilities
  - Inferred specifications from git history
  - Framework-specific quality standards
```

**Conditional Specification Creation:**
```yaml
if_user_chose_specification_files:
  actions:
    - create_directories: ".quaestor/specifications/"
    - generate_readme: "Goals, success criteria, timeline"
    - create_spec_yaml: "Specification with contract and acceptance criteria"
    - initialize_notes: "Implementation notes and decisions"
  
if_user_chose_documentation_only:
  actions:
    - populate_memory_templates: "Update MEMORY.md with specification information"
    - skip_specification_directories: "No .quaestor/specifications/ creation"

mandatory_for_both:
  - populate_architecture_md: "Real project analysis"
  - update_critical_rules: "Framework-specific guidelines"
  - configure_quality_standards: "Testing and linting setup"
```

## Framework-Specific Intelligence

### React/Frontend Projects
```yaml
React Analysis:
  State Management: Redux|Context|Zustand detection
  Component Patterns: HOC|Hooks|Render Props
  Architecture: SPA|SSR|Static Site patterns
  Quality Gates: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript
  
Generated Specifications:
  - Component Library Setup
  - State Management Implementation
  - Testing Infrastructure
  - Performance Optimization
```

### Python/Backend Projects
```yaml
Python Analysis:
  Framework: Django|FastAPI|Flask detection
  Patterns: MVC|Repository|Service Layer
  Testing: pytest|unittest setup
  Quality Gates: ruff + mypy + pytest
  
Generated Specifications:
  - API Design & Models
  - Authentication System
  - Database Integration
  - Production Deployment
```

## Agent Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation for Agent Failures:**
```yaml
Error Handling Strategy:
  If researcher agent fails:
    - Fall back to basic file detection (package.json, requirements.txt)
    - Log: "Framework detection limited - manual review recommended"
    - Continue with available data
  
  If architect agent fails:
    - Use simplified pattern detection based on folder structure
    - Log: "Architecture analysis incomplete - patterns may be missed"
    - Continue with basic analysis
  
  If security agent fails:
    - Flag for manual security review
    - Log: "Security assessment skipped - manual review required"
    - Continue without security recommendations
  
  If planner agent fails:
    - Generate basic specification templates
    - Log: "Specification generation limited - customize as needed"
    - Provide manual specification guide

Performance Monitoring:
  - Total time limit: 30 seconds
  - Individual agent timeout: 10 seconds
  - Parallel execution to maximize efficiency
```

## Adaptive Specification Generation
**Smart Phase Detection:**
```yaml
Project Analysis ‚Üí Specification Generation:
  - New projects: Foundation ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Polish phases
  - In-progress: Analyze git history ‚Üí identify next logical phase
  - Legacy: Assessment ‚Üí Modernization ‚Üí Enhancement
  
Example Specification Sets:
  Startup (0-6 months):
    - "MVP Foundation"

    - "Production Hardening"
  
  Enterprise (18+ months):

    - "Scalability Improvements"
    - "Platform Maturation"
```
