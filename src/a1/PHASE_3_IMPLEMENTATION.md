# A1 Phase 3: Rule Intelligence Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of A1 Phase 3 Rule Intelligence features, which introduce graduated enforcement, context-aware adaptation, rule learning, and exception tracking to the Quaestor system.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Graduated Enforcement System

**Location**: `src/a1/enforcement/`

- **Enforcement Levels** (`enforcement_levels.py`):
  - INFORM: Log information, no action required
  - WARN: Show warning, allow continuation  
  - JUSTIFY: Require justification to proceed
  - BLOCK: Block action unless override provided

- **Rule Enforcer** (`rule_enforcer.py`):
  - Base class for all enforcement rules
  - Handles enforcement flow and history tracking
  - Supports override recording

- **Adaptive Enforcer** (`adaptive_enforcer.py`):
  - Extends base enforcer with context adaptation
  - Implements `AdaptiveResearchRule` and `AdaptiveComplexityRule`
  - Dynamically adjusts enforcement based on context

### 2. Context-Aware Rule Adaptation

**Location**: `src/a1/enforcement/`

- **Rule Adapter** (`rule_adapter.py`):
  - Detects workflow strategies (research, testing, hotfix, etc.)
  - Adjusts enforcement levels based on:
    - Developer experience (0-1 scale)
    - Time pressure (0-1 scale)  
    - Workflow phase
    - Intent clarity

- **Context Factors** (`context_factors.py`):
  - Analyzes various context signals
  - Calculates risk scores
  - Detects urgency indicators
  - Evaluates file criticality

### 3. Rule Learning System

**Location**: `src/a1/learning/`

- **Pattern Recognizer** (`pattern_recognizer.py`):
  - Records rule exceptions and overrides
  - Detects patterns in exceptions
  - Requires 3+ occurrences within 7 days

- **Confidence Scorer** (`confidence_scorer.py`):
  - Scores pattern confidence based on:
    - Frequency (logarithmic scale)
    - Recency (exponential decay)
    - Consistency (success rate)
    - Context match

- **Exception Clustering** (`exception_clustering.py`):
  - Groups similar exceptions
  - Uses weighted feature similarity
  - Updates cluster centers iteratively

- **Learned Patterns Store** (`learned_patterns_store.py`):
  - Persists learned patterns
  - Applies confidence decay
  - Maintains pattern index by rule

### 4. Exception Tracking & Analytics

**Location**: `src/a1/analytics/`

- **Exception Tracker** (`exception_tracker.py`):
  - Records all enforcement events
  - Provides event summaries
  - Calculates override rates
  - Detects common patterns

- **Pattern Detector** (`pattern_detector.py`):
  - Analyzes exception patterns
  - Groups by common attributes
  - Provides pattern insights

### 5. Integration Layer

**Location**: `src/a1/hooks/`

- **Intelligent Base Hook** (`intelligent_base.py`):
  - Bridge between A1 and Quaestor systems
  - Maps 4-level enforcement to binary HookResult
  - Integrates learning and adaptation

- **Context Builder** (`context_builder.py`):
  - Builds rich enforcement context
  - Detects developer experience from git
  - Analyzes time pressure signals

- **Concrete Hooks** (`intelligent_hooks.py`):
  - IntelligentResearchHook
  - IntelligentComplexityHook
  - IntelligentTestHook

## Integration with Quaestor

The A1 system integrates with Quaestor's existing hook system through:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Quaestor hooks continue to work unchanged
2. **Mapping Layer**: 4-level enforcement maps to binary HookResult:
   - INFORM/WARN → allow=True
   - JUSTIFY/BLOCK → allow=False
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Teams can migrate hooks gradually

## Usage Example

```python
from src.a1.enforcement import AdaptiveResearchRule, EnforcementHistory
from src.a1.learning import PatternRecognizer

# Create components
history = EnforcementHistory()
rule = AdaptiveResearchRule(history=history)
recognizer = PatternRecognizer()

# Enforce rule
context = EnforcementContext(
    user_intent="implement feature",
    workflow_phase="implementing",
    developer_experience=0.7,
    metadata={"files_examined": 2}
)

result = rule.enforce(context)
if not result.allowed:
    print(result.message)
    print("Suggestions:", result.suggestions)
```

## Testing

Tests are located in `tests/test_a1_basic.py` and cover:
- Enforcement level hierarchy
- Adaptive rule behavior
- Context-aware adaptation
- Pattern recognition
- Exception tracking
- Component integration

Run tests with: `python -m tests.test_a1_basic`

## Configuration

The system uses sensible defaults but can be configured through:
- `AdaptationFactors`: Weight different context factors
- `ConfidenceFactors`: Adjust pattern confidence calculation
- Strategy configurations in `RuleAdapter`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML models for pattern detection
2. **Team-Level Learning**: Share patterns across team members
3. **Visualization Dashboard**: Show enforcement trends and patterns
4. **Custom Rule Builder**: UI for creating new adaptive rules
5. **A/B Testing**: Compare enforcement strategies
