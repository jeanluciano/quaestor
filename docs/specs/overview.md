# Specification-Driven Development

Quaestor uses specification-driven development to provide structure and clarity to AI-assisted development workflows.

## What are Specifications?

Specifications are formal documents that define exactly what needs to be built. Each specification includes:

- **Contract**: Precise inputs, outputs, and behavior rules
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable success conditions
- **Test Scenarios**: Given/When/Then test cases
- **Implementation Tracking**: Automatic progress monitoring

## Why Use Specifications?

### Clear Requirements
- Forces detailed thinking before implementation
- Prevents scope creep with defined contracts
- Ensures all stakeholders understand the requirements

### Better Testing
- Test scenarios defined upfront
- Systematic coverage of edge cases
- Integration between requirements and tests

### Automatic Tracking
- Progress tracked through specification status
- Branch-to-spec linking
- Milestone completion based on spec implementation

## Specification Structure

Each specification contains:

```yaml
id: feat-auth-001
title: User Authentication System
type: feature
priority: high
status: draft

contract:
  inputs:
    - username: string (required)
    - password: string (required, min 8 chars)
  outputs:
    - token: JWT string
    - user: User object
  behavior:
    - Validate credentials against database
    - Generate JWT with 24h expiration
    - Log authentication attempts

acceptance_criteria:
  - User can login with valid credentials
  - Invalid credentials return error message
  - JWT token expires after 24 hours
  - Failed attempts are logged

test_scenarios:
  - name: Valid login
    given: User exists with correct password
    when: Login request sent
    then: JWT token returned
```

## Specification Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial specification created
2. **Approved**: Contract and criteria reviewed and approved
3. **In Progress**: Implementation started, linked to branch
4. **Implemented**: Code complete according to contract
5. **Tested**: All test scenarios pass
6. **Deployed**: Feature live in production

## Benefits

- **Structured Development**: Clear process from requirements to implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and validation
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time tracking of implementation status
- **Team Coordination**: Shared understanding of requirements
- **Documentation**: Specifications serve as living documentation
