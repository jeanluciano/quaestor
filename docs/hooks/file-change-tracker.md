# File Change Tracker Hook

The File Change Tracker maintains a record of all file modifications, providing context and history for development activities.

## Purpose

This hook:
- Records all file modifications
- Tracks change patterns
- Provides modification history
- Identifies frequently changed files
- Supports rollback decisions

## Tracking Mechanism

### Change Recording
For each file modification:
```json
{
  "file": "src/api/users.py",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "operation": "Edit",
  "changes": {
    "lines_added": 15,
    "lines_removed": 5,
    "functions_modified": ["create_user", "validate_email"]
  },
  "context": {
    "todo_id": "TODO-123",
    "spec_id": "auth-spec-001",
    "commit_sha": "abc123def"
  }
}
```

### Pattern Analysis
Identifies:
- Hotspot files (frequently modified)
- Change clusters (related modifications)
- Refactoring patterns
- Bug-prone areas
- Architecture evolution

## Features

### Change History
Maintains a chronological log of:
- File modifications
- Creation/deletion events
- Rename operations
- Permission changes
- Content transformations

### Statistical Analysis
Provides insights on:
- Most modified files
- Change frequency patterns
- Developer touch points
- Time-based trends
- Coupling detection

### Integration Context
Links changes to:
- TODO items being addressed
- Specifications being implemented
- Bug fixes applied
- Features added
- Refactoring performed

## Output Examples

### Session Summary
```
üìù File Change Summary (This Session)

Modified: 12 files
Created: 3 files
Deleted: 1 file

Most changed:
1. src/api/auth.py (5 modifications)
2. tests/test_auth.py (4 modifications)
3. src/models/user.py (3 modifications)

Change context:
- Implementing auth-spec-001
- Fixing TODO-123, TODO-124
- Refactoring user validation
```

### Hot File Detection
```
üî• Hot File Alert

src/api/users.py has been modified 8 times in 2 days

Recent changes:
- Added input validation
- Fixed email regex
- Updated error handling
- Added rate limiting
- Enhanced logging

Consider: This file may need refactoring or stabilization
```

## Use Cases

### Development Insights
- Identify unstable code areas
- Track feature implementation progress
- Understand code evolution
- Detect coupling between files

### Quality Improvement
- Find frequently modified files for refactoring
- Identify bug-prone modules
- Track technical debt accumulation
- Monitor architecture changes

### Team Collaboration
- See what others have modified
- Understand change contexts
- Track feature ownership
- Coordinate parallel work

## Configuration

### Tracking Options
```yaml
file_change_tracker:
  track_patterns:
    - "src/**/*.py"
    - "tests/**/*.py"
  exclude_patterns:
    - "**/__pycache__/**"
    - "*.pyc"
  
  analysis:
    hot_file_threshold: 5  # modifications
    time_window: 48  # hours
    
  storage:
    max_history: 1000  # entries
    rotation: weekly
```

### Custom Analyzers
Add project-specific analysis:
- Architecture violation detection
- Performance impact assessment
- Security change monitoring
- Dependency modification tracking

## Best Practices

1. Review change summaries regularly
2. Address hot files proactively
3. Link changes to tickets/specs
4. Use insights for refactoring decisions
5. Monitor architectural drift

## Integration Points

- **With Specifications**: Links changes to spec implementation
- **With TODOs**: Associates modifications with tasks
- **With Git**: Correlates with commit history
- **With QA**: Identifies areas needing extra testing
