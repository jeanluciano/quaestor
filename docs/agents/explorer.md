# Explorer Agent

The Explorer agent helps you navigate and understand codebases through intelligent exploration and analysis.

## Purpose

The Explorer agent specializes in:
- Mapping codebase structure and dependencies
- Finding specific implementations or patterns
- Understanding data flow and architecture
- Discovering hidden connections
- Creating mental models of complex systems

## When to Use

Use the Explorer agent when:
- Starting work on an unfamiliar codebase
- Need to understand how components interact
- Looking for specific patterns or implementations
- Mapping out system architecture
- Investigating cross-cutting concerns

## Example Usage

```
Use the explorer agent to map out the authentication flow in this application
```

## Capabilities

- **Codebase Mapping**: Creates visual and textual maps of code structure
- **Dependency Analysis**: Traces imports and dependencies
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common patterns and anti-patterns
- **Flow Analysis**: Tracks data and control flow
- **Documentation Discovery**: Finds relevant docs and comments

## Output Format

The Explorer typically provides:
1. High-level architecture overview
2. Component relationships diagram
3. Key file locations and purposes
4. Important patterns discovered
5. Recommended next exploration steps

## Best Practices

1. Start with a specific exploration goal
2. Provide context about what you're looking for
3. Mention any specific areas of interest
4. Ask for visual representations when helpful
5. Request follow-up explorations based on findings
