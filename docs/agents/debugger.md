# Debugger Agent

The Debugger agent helps identify and resolve bugs, errors, and unexpected behavior in your code.

## Purpose

The Debugger agent specializes in:
- Analyzing error messages and stack traces
- Identifying root causes of bugs
- Implementing debugging strategies
- Adding logging and monitoring
- Creating reproducible test cases

## When to Use

Use the Debugger agent when:
- You encounter runtime errors or exceptions
- Code behavior doesn't match expectations
- You need to trace execution flow
- Performance issues need investigation
- You need to add debugging instrumentation

## Example Usage

```
/debug TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

## Capabilities

- **Error Analysis**: Parses and explains error messages
- **Stack Trace Investigation**: Traces execution paths
- **Variable Inspection**: Identifies problematic state
- **Test Case Creation**: Builds minimal reproductions
- **Fix Implementation**: Provides and implements solutions

## Best Practices

1. Provide complete error messages including stack traces
2. Include relevant code context
3. Describe expected vs actual behavior
4. Mention any recent changes that might be related
5. Include environment details if relevant
